            <h2>The Origins of Phrenology</h2>
            <h3>Phrenology was developed by German physician Franz Joseph Gall in 1796. The discipline was influential in 
                the 19th century, especially from about 1810 until 1840.</h3>

            <h3>Phrenology was mostly discredited as a scientific theory by the 1840s, when scientific experiments showed that
                the mental faculties proposed by Phrenologist does not correspond to the actual functions of that part of the brain
